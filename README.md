# PresRecST: A novel herbal prescription recommendation algorithm for real-world patients with integration of syndrome differentiation and treatment planning

## 1. Introduction
This repository contains source code and datasets for "PresRecST: A novel herbal prescription recommendation algorithm
for real-world patients with integration of syndrome differentiation and treatment planning". 

In this study, we proposed a novel herbal Prescription Recommendation network architecture for real-world patients with
integration of Syndrome differentiation and Treatment planning (PresRecST, See Fig1), following the basic diagnostic and
treatment process of real-world syndrome differentiation and treatment determination.

## 2. Overview

![PresRecST Framework](fig/PresRecST_framework.png)

Fig1. Framework of PresRecST. The model takes the knowledge embedding matrices of SDTKG and the patientâ€™s symptom set as
input, and combines them with the residual-like neural network for recommending syndromes(SDM), treatment methods(TMM) and
herbs(HRM) progressively.

## 3. Data Availability

The datasets used in this study include the following two sources:  
1. **TCM-PD [Yao et al., TKDE 2018]**: A widely utilized TCM prescription dictionary dataset, frequently employed in research on TCM prescription recommendation.  
2. **TCM-Lung [constructed in this study]**: A clinical TCM dataset focused on lung diseases.
